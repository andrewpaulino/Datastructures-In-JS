# Data Structures In JS
In this git repo, I will be recreating as many data structures as I can in Javascript (Node.js v12.18.3). I've
done them in C++, but would like to see if I can recreate them in
Javascript all the same. This is for personal practice only, and will
try to do one a day, but atlas things come up or issues so I guess
whenever it happens it happens.

## Main Idea I'll be recreating popular Data Structures from LinkedList to Heaps or Binary Trees. I think it is important to know

them as it relates to the fundamentals of Computer Science.

## List Of Data Structures

- [x] LinkedList
- [ ] Double LinkedList
- [ ] Circular LinkedList
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Priority Queues
- [ ] Binary Tree
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] AVL Trees
- [ ] Graph
- [ ] Matrix

### Why is _X_ Data Structure not on here? It's simple, I am not including every possible data structure but focusing on the

fundamentals I've noticed to be frequently used in technical
interviews.

## How to test a data structure

1.  Clone Repository
2.  `npm i`
3.  `node {data structure}.js`
